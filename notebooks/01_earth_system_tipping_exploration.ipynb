    "## Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Timescale Mismatch Prevents Cascades\n",
    "The two-order-of-magnitude difference between Amazon (1 yr) and Greenland (98 yr) timescales creates a fundamental barrier to cascade propagation. Fast oscillations in Amazon don't persist long enough to influence slow ice sheet dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Lévy vs Gaussian Noise Produces Qualitatively Different Dynamics\n",
    "- **Lévy (α=1.5):** Heavy-tailed, extreme events, back-tipping possible\n",
    "- **Gaussian (α=2.0):** Bounded fluctuations, smoother trajectories\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Coupling Strength Affects Stability, Not Cascade Initiation\n",
    "Increasing coupling from 0.25 to 0.50 didn't trigger cascades but did help maintain state separation once elements had tipped independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. GIS Decoupling at ~42k Years is Robust\n",
    "Across multiple experiments, GIS consistently transitioned around t=40-42k years, suggesting this is an intrinsic property of the model configuration rather than a noise artifact.\n",
